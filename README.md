# Nebula
A developer dashboard for apps and tools

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
- Node.js 20+ if you prefer running the services outside of Docker

## Quick start with Docker

The easiest way to run Nebula is with Docker Compose which spins up Postgres, the API server and the Angular frontâ€‘end. Everything can be built and started with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Alternatively you can run the provided helper script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Once the services are running, open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser. The API will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Environment variables for the backend are defined in `backend/.env.example`. You can create your own `backend/.env` file with the same keys to override the defaults.

To stop the stack press `Ctrl+C` and then run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Running without Docker

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
